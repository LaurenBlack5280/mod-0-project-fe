## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
I tend to wait too long. I really like figuring things out on my own.
2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
NUMBERS- used for numerical values
STRINGS- any text wrapped in quotes
BOOLEANS- used when the value can vary
3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
```console.log("Hello World!")
```
4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
Two backslashes `//` indicate a comment. Code comments allow developers to remember why decisions were made
5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
A variable is a way of storing a value for use in multiple places.
6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
The variables would probably include Name, Birthdate, Online Status. They would employ these data types, respectively strings, numbers, and booleans.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
concatenation is joining together a string with one or more data types.
8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?
I believe zoom uses it. I accidently entered my age incorrectly and was kicked off. My guess is that the string included both
my name and my birthdate which would be string in addition to a boolean.
9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
I'm not sure my annotation is correct when working with Booleans.
