## Section 3 Reflection

1. In Section 3, we removed even more supports and pushed you to learn a bit more independently, read through technical documentation, and use your resources more. How did that feel?
It felt both frustrating and exciting.
2. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
Social media sites use arrays to keep track of thier list of users.
3. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
Array methods are functions that can change an array. They include (but are not limited to) `.pop`, `.push`, `.shift`,
`.unshift` they are common functions.
4. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
Loops check a condition. The code block will run if a value of true is returned. With an array, loops run the same
code for each item in the list.
5. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
My 3 year old was looking over my shoulder when I reading about Loops! He loudly announced the word "Loops"!
I read aloud the definition in the required reading. What I should have explained was loops work a lot like
how mommy works. I have to check that conditions are met before an action can be executed. For instance, I'll
ask you to put on your shoes before we go outside. So, when i have to repeat myself, this is like a loop. The first
action must be completed before the second action takes place.
6. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
I really don't know what I don't know. There's more to learn for sure, but I don't know what to ask. It seems
like we only touched the surface.
