## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
I like the idea that mistakes are a part of learning and not a distraction from it. Also, asking for help makes you a better
programmer.
2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
I demonstrate it by setting measurable goals. Positive progression over perfection. I am also open to feedback and suggestions.
I'm not great at asking for help and will struggle with a problem alone longer than necessary.
3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
I liked practicing running node without directions. I did my best to recall how to do it from memory. I still had to look it up,
but I was close! It's fun to practice the things I learn as I learn them. I'm now glad to read that the directions were intentionally vague. I got confused and it definitely made me uncomfortable. I went to study hall, and another student was stuck
on the same question. That made me feel better knowing I wasn't the only one who didn't fully understand.
4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
It is an if/then statement. If my son puts on his shoes, then he can go outside. On reddit, if I join a subreddit, then I will
see it's content on my feed.
5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
Add else if for the additional conditions. The program reads each line of code and only runs the line that meets all the expected conditions.
6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
The dev tools on Chrome allow you to see that conditions are met before running a block of code.
7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
I don't have particular questions because this is all still very new and I don't know what I don't know. More opportunity to work on if statements would be appreciated.
